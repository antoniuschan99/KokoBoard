This app is a minimum viable product that I created to prototype an idea I had in mind.  During those times when we aren’t in the same location as our peers, how could we quickly draw out our thoughts in the same fashion as a whiteboard? Unlike the PC (and the mouse), the iPad is the perfect medium to allow us to draw because of its touch sensitive surface. TeamBoard utilizes the iPad as the whiteboard and transmits the drawings you make onto a public facing URL so anyone with that link can see what you’re drawing. The app is created using Meteor.js, MongoDB, and the canvas element in HTML5. No libraries were used, just pure JavaScript!
